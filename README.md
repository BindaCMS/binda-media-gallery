# Binda API
A Media Gallery for [Binda CMS](http://github.com/lacolonia/binda).

**Binda** is a headless CMS with an intuitive out-of-the-box interface which makes very easy creating application infrastructures. For more info about Binda structure please visit the [official documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/binda)

## Work in progress

Binda is based on Carrierwave and does not manage multiple instances of the same file.

With this plugin we will undertake some major refactors:

1. Introducing [Active Storage](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html) which will replace Carrierwave entirely.
2. Implementing a new feature based on React which will replace the current file upload field.


## Steps

The direction is set, but there's much to be done before the top. Follow the conversation [here](https://github.com/BindaCMS/binda-media-gallery/projects/1).
